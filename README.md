# ChromedriverTaskKiller
**Chromedriver.exe process counter and killer with runtime**

This short repository contains two methods that may be useful for automation testers using browser drivers like chromedriver. 
The processCounter method accepting the String argument (name of the process to be counted) counts active processes with the given name. 
The processKiller method, taking a String argument (the name of the process to kill), kills all active processes with the given name.
